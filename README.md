# Members-Only

Members only is a site where users can enter a message that can be seen by anyone who visits the website.

## Description

In this project I built an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it

## Features

List the key features of your project. Use bullet points for clarity.

## Installation

```bash
git clone the repo 
npm install
create an env file, include your mongoDB address, your Member password and Admin password inside the env file so you can get to use more features
create a gitignore file and include your env inside the gitignore file
